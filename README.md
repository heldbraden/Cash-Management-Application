### Desciption:
The Cash Management Web Application provides users with a tool to manage their finances. Start with an initial balance/budget, and add transactions by entering a description, amount (positive or negative), and date. The application automatically updates your balance with each transaction. Users can delete specific transactions and sort transactions to view positive or negative entries separately, offering a clear and organized overview of their financial history.
